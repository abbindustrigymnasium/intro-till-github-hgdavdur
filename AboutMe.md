## **Hobbies and etc**
### I am a big fan of korean and chinese novels and stories, during my free time I read a lot of novels which has helped me greatly in expanding my vocabulary. I don't really know which one is my favorite, however if I had to choose one, it would most probably be [*Shadow Slave*](https://shadowslave.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Slave_Wiki). The name of this novel was the inspiration behind my gaming nickname **Shadow**, which was further influenced by the popular manga [*One Piece*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) and instead became **Shadow D. White**. I use that nickname to this day.

## **Why?**
### Why did I enroll at [*Hitachi Highschool*](https://vasteras.hitachigymnasiet.se/) specifically? Well to tell you the truth my choice of Highschool was greatly impacted by my older brother who graduated said Highschool 3 years ago.
